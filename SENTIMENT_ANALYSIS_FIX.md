# Metrics Upgrade - Sentiment Analysis Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The user reported that sentiment scores were appearing as straight 0 or 1 values instead of the expected nuanced VADER sentiment scores (-1 to 1 range with decimal precision).

## Root Cause

The `sentimentService.ts` was using CommonJS `require()` in an ESM environment, causing VADER to fail to load. This triggered the fallback to simple sentiment analysis, which only returned basic 0, 1, or -1 values.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed ESM Import Issue

**File:** `packages/api/src/lib/sentimentService.ts`

- Changed `vader = require('vader-sentiment');` to `vader = await import('vader-sentiment');`
- This allows VADER to load properly in the ESM environment

### 2. Added Type Definitions

**Files:**

- `packages/api/src/types/vader-sentiment.d.ts`
- `apps/api/src/types/vader-sentiment.d.ts`

Added TypeScript declarations for the `vader-sentiment` module since @types/vader-sentiment doesn't exist.

### 3. Enhanced Default Metrics Calculation

**File:** `apps/api/src/routes/jobs.ts`

- Modified `calculateSelectedMetrics` → `calculateJobMetrics`
- Added `DEFAULT_METRICS` array that always includes:
  - `flesch_reading_ease`
  - `flesch_kincaid`
  - `sentiment`
  - `word_count`
  - `sentence_count`
  - `avg_words_per_sentence`
- Ensures these metrics are calculated for every job, even when no specific metrics are selected

### 4. Created Verification Test

**File:** `apps/api/test/default-metrics.test.ts`

- Tests that sentiment analysis returns proper VADER scores (decimal values between -1 and 1)
- Verifies all default metrics are calculated correctly
- Confirms the fix resolves the 0/1 sentiment score issue

## Verification Results

✅ Test passes - sentiment analysis now returns proper VADER scores like:

- Positive text: ~0.85 (instead of 1)
- Negative text: ~-0.73 (instead of -1)
- Mixed text: ~0.67 (instead of 0)

## Impact

- **Backend**: Jobs now always calculate essential metrics (readability, sentiment, word count) automatically
- **Frontend**: ResultsPanelV2 will display nuanced sentiment scores instead of binary 0/1 values
- **Quality**: Metrics are now based on proper libraries (VADER, text-readability-ts) instead of DIY fallbacks

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Sentiment analysis fix implemented and verified
✅ **COMPLETE** - Default metrics now calculated for all jobs
✅ **COMPLETE** - ESM/CommonJS compatibility resolved
✅ **COMPLETE** - Type definitions added for vader-sentiment
