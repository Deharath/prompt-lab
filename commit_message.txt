feat(ci): improve CI configuration and package scripts

This commit introduces several improvements to the CI workflow and package scripts:

-   **Enforce Node.js & pnpm versions:** Adds an `engines` field to `package.json` to ensure a consistent development and CI environment.
-   **Update pnpm in CI:** Aligns the pnpm version in `ci.yml` with the version specified in `package.json`.
-   **Eliminate Redundant Tests:** Corrects the root `test` script in `package.json` to prevent duplicate test runs, which speeds up the local and CI test execution.
