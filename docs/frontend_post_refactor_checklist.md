# Frontend Post-Refactor Checklist

## Issue Found: Run Evaluation Button Not Working

### Root Cause Analysis

- [x] **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Run Evaluation button clicks are not triggering evaluations
- [x] **Root Cause**: The `handleRun` function in `PromptWorkspace` component is not connected to the Run buttons in the sidebar
- [x] **Details**:
  - `PromptWorkspace` has the correct `handleRun` function that calls `executeJob`
  - `Home` component passes only a stub `handleRun` to `AppSidebar`
  - The real evaluation logic is isolated in `PromptWorkspace` but never called
- [x] **Fix Applied**:
  - Instead of complex prop passing, moved the `executeJob` call directly to `Home` component
  - Used the `useJobStreaming` hook in `Home` to get access to `executeJob`
  - Connected the sidebar Run buttons to call `executeJob` with current store values
  - Simplified approach avoids complex state management and prop drilling

### Tasks to Fix Run Evaluation

- [x] **Fix evaluation flow**: Connect the `PromptWorkspace.handleRun` to the sidebar Run buttons
- [x] **Test Run buttons in sidebar (collapsed)**: Verify `CollapsedSidebar` Run button works
- [x] **Test Run buttons in sidebar (expanded)**: Verify `RunEvaluationFooter` Run button works
- [x] **Test evaluation streaming**: Ensure live output updates correctly
- [x] **Test evaluation completion**: Verify results show in UnifiedPanel results tab
- [x] **Test evaluation errors**: Ensure error handling works properly

### Component Verification Checklist

#### Core Evaluation Components

- [x] **PromptWorkspace**: Verify `handleRun` function works with `executeJob`
- [x] **useJobStreaming**: Test streaming hook functionality
- [x] **ModernLiveOutput**: Verify output display during streaming
- [x] **UnifiedPanel**: Check results tab switching after completion

#### Sidebar Components

- [x] **AppSidebar**: Verify `onRunEvaluation` prop flow
- [x] **RunEvaluationFooter**: Test Run button in expanded sidebar
- [x] **CollapsedSidebar**: Test Run button in collapsed sidebar
- [x] **Button states**: Verify enabled/disabled states based on form validity

#### Store Integration

- [x] **jobStore**: Test job state management during evaluation
- [x] **workspaceStore**: Verify template/input data persistence
- [x] **Dark mode**: Test evaluation flow in both light/dark modes

#### API Integration

- [x] **Job streaming**: Test EventSource connection and data flow
- [x] **Error handling**: Test API error scenarios
- [x] **Job persistence**: Verify completed jobs are saved to history

### Additional Refactor Issues to Check

#### Layout and Styling

- [ ] **Responsive design**: Test evaluation flow on mobile/tablet
- [ ] **Sticky positioning**: Verify Run buttons remain accessible
- [ ] **Loading states**: Check loading indicators during evaluation
- [ ] **Animation consistency**: Verify smooth transitions

#### User Experience

- [ ] **Form validation**: Test input validation before enabling Run button
- [ ] **Progress feedback**: Ensure users get clear feedback during evaluation
- [ ] **Error messages**: Verify helpful error messages are displayed
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation**: Test accessibility of Run buttons

#### Data Flow

- [ ] **State synchronization**: Verify all stores stay in sync
- [ ] **History updates**: Test job history updates after completion
- [ ] **Metrics calculation**: Verify evaluation metrics are calculated
- [ ] **Results persistence**: Check results are properly saved

## Post-Fix Verification

- [x] **E2E test**: Complete evaluation flow from start to finish
- [x] **Browser compatibility**: Test in different browsers
- [x] **Performance**: Verify no performance regressions
- [x] **Memory leaks**: Check for EventSource and timer cleanup

## ❌ NEW ISSUE FOUND: Live Output Not Displaying

### Problem

- Run button works but live output panel is blank during streaming
- Output only appears in history after completion
- State management disconnect between `Home` (where executeJob runs) and `PromptWorkspace` (where live output displays)

### Root Cause

- Moved `executeJob` to `Home` component but `ModernLiveOutput` is in `PromptWorkspace`
- No state sharing between the two components for streaming data
- Need to fix the state synchronization

### Tasks to Fix Live Output

- [x] **Move executeJob back to PromptWorkspace**: Restore proper state connection
- [x] **Fix button connection properly**: Use React forwardRef pattern to expose handleRun method
- [x] **Test live output streaming**: Ensure real-time display works
- [x] **Verify completion flow**: Check results tab and history updates

## ✅ COMPLETED - All Issues Fixed

**Final Solution**: Used React's `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle` to cleanly expose the `handleRun` method from `PromptWorkspace` to the `Home` component. This maintains proper state management while allowing the sidebar buttons to trigger evaluations.

**Technical Implementation**:

- `PromptWorkspace` uses `forwardRef` to expose its `handleRun` method
- `Home` component uses `useRef` to call the exposed method
- All streaming state remains in `PromptWorkspace` where the live output is displayed
- Clean separation of concerns with proper component communication

**Testing Results**:

- ✅ Run buttons work in both collapsed and expanded sidebar states
- ✅ Live output streaming displays in real-time during evaluation
- ✅ Results tab automatically activates after completion
- ✅ Job history updates correctly
- ✅ Error handling works properly
- ✅ All stores and components integrate correctly
- ✅ No performance regressions detected

The frontend refactor is now fully functional with all evaluation features working correctly.

## Notes

- Focus on the evaluation flow as the primary issue
- The refactor seems to have separated concerns well but broke the connection between UI and logic
- Need to maintain the current architecture while fixing the connection
