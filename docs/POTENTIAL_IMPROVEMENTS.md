# Potential Architectural and Organizational Improvements

This document outlines minor areas for potential improvement in the repository's structure and organization. These are not flaws, but rather small, "quality-of-life" refinements that could enhance clarity and maintainability for current and future developers.

Based on a review on July 6, 2025, the following points were noted:

### 1. Naming Ambiguity Between `packages/api` and `apps/api`

**Concern:** A new developer might initially find the presence of two `api` directories confusing.

- `apps/api`: The deployable Express.js server.
- `packages/api`: The core library for evaluation logic and metrics services.

**Suggestion:**

To make the distinction immediately obvious, consider renaming `packages/api` to a more descriptive name that reflects its purpose, such as:

- `packages/evaluation-engine`
- `packages/prompt-lab-core`
- `packages/metrics-engine`

This would clarify that one is the application and the other is the reusable core logic it depends on.

### 2. Add Documentation for Scripts

**Concern:** The `scripts/` directory contains several utility and maintenance files, but their purpose is not immediately clear without reading the code.

**Suggestion:**

Create a `README.md` file inside the `scripts/` directory. This file should briefly explain:

- What each script does (e.g., `migrate.ts`, `health-check.sh`).
- How to run it.
- Any environment variables or arguments it requires.

This would improve the developer experience and make it easier to use these utility scripts.
