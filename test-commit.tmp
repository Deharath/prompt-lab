fix(ui): Resolve dark mode initialization and styling conflicts

This commit addresses two issues related to the dark mode functionality:

1.  **Initialization Logic:** The dark mode toggle was not functioning correctly on the first click because the Zustand store's initial state was not being properly hydrated from local storage or the user's system preferences. The `onRehydrateStorage` function was not sufficient to handle this.

2.  **CSS Override:** A CSS rule using `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` was forcing dark mode based on the operating system's theme, overriding the user's selected preference.

These issues have been resolved by:
- Refactoring the `darkModeStore` to correctly initialize its state from local storage or system preference at the time of creation.
- Removing the conflicting CSS media query to ensure that the JavaScript-based theme toggle has full control.
- Passing the `isDarkMode` state to the `QualitySummaryDashboard` component to enable dark mode styling.
